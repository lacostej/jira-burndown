See http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEVNET/Developing+your+Plugin+using+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK for general notes regarding plugin development.

Notes:
* The burndown plugin is based on Portlets which aren't supported in Jira 4.2. It needs to be converted to Gadgets
http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEV/Legacy+Portlet+Bridge
http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Writing+a+Plugin+Upgrade+Task+for+JIRA+4.0

There's a bridge to support old portlets but I think it was only working for Jira 4.0
http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-18521
http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-19213

* don't try (yet) porting the plugin to plugins-version="2" (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Differences+between+Plugins1+and+Plugins2).
  It will cause some issues:
** you will have classloader issues in the component instantiation (
  You might need to add something like that to get the JDNI source location to work
  VersionWorkloadHistoryManagerImpl#getJiraJNDIDataSource
  Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(VersionWorkloadHistoryManagerImpl.class.getClassLoader().getClass().getClassLoader());

** the service won't run as the plugin needs to be deployed under WEB-INF/lib

Today the plugin works in the following way
* a service collects data and stores it in custom tables
* the portlet is triggered by velocity.
  ChartPortlet#getVelocityParams retrieves the velocity 'model' and passes it on to versionWorkloadChart.vm for displaying the generated image.

Task:
* convert portlet to Gadget

* portlet URL:

It should be possible to write a simple gadget that pulls the graph from the existing portlet. The portlet can be retrieved here, but for some reasons, graph generation can take quite a bit of time on my test env.
Strange, the code just involves a few calls to JFreeChart.
