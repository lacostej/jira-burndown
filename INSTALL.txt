
INSTALL
===========================
The .jar file should be placed in /WEB-INF/lib of the expanded jira webapplication
in addition to any other libraries required by the plugin. Required libraries are:
 * Spring 1.1.5 or later +
 * Libraries available with Jira 3.9.1

You probably need to restart the webapp for the libraries to be available. You can check
whether or not the plugins (and thus the jar) have been loaded from 
ADMINISTRATION - SYSTEM - Plugins. You should see "LaughingPanda" under the installed 
plugins.

Jira administration:

The workload history is collected by a Jira Service implementation which stores 
snapshots of the workload to database. This service can be started from
ADMINISTRATION - SYSTEM - Services
