
INSTALL
===========================
The .jar file should be placed in /WEB-INF/lib of the expanded jira webapplication
in addition to Spring Framework which is required by the plugin. 
 
You can get Spring 2.0.6 from here:

ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/packages/maven2/org/springframework/spring/2.0.6/spring-2.0.6.jar 

You should place the downloaded jar alongside with the agile-plugins.jar 

For database you do not need to do anything (if this is a new plugin installation) since 
the plugin will automatically create the necessary tables on first run.

You probably need to restart the webapp for the libraries to be available. You can check
whether or not the plugins (and thus the jar) have been loaded from 
ADMINISTRATION - SYSTEM - Plugins. You should see "LaughingPanda" under the installed 
plugins.

Jira administration:
--------------------
The workload history is collected by a Jira Service implementation which stores 
snapshots of the workload to database. This service can be started from
ADMINISTRATION - SYSTEM - Services

Add Service
Name: <you choose>
Class: com.laughingpanda.jira.VersionWorkloadHistoryService
Delay: <you choose>

You should be ready rock.

UPGRADE
===========================
If you are upgrading from an older version of the Agile Plugins, you might need to manually
alter the database table which the plugin uses for storing the history information.

Check your corresponding database create scripts under <YourDatabase>/create.sql for the table
definition and check how that differs from your current table definition and alter it to match.

If you don't mind losing the old data then you can of course just drop the table and the new tables 
will be created by the plugins at startup.
