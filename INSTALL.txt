
INSTALL
===========================
The .jar file should be placed in /WEB-INF/lib of the expanded jira webapplication
in addition to any other libraries required by the plugin. (See maven.xml)

For the Portlet icons and thumbnails to work you should expand /portlet/** from the 
.jar file to the expanded jira webapplication /portlet directory so the images
can be accessed by the browser.

Currently the database tables have to be created manually. You should run 
createTables.sql against the java:comp/env/JiraDS database to create the necessary
tables to hold the workload history.

You probably need to restart the webapp for the libraries to be available. You can check
whether or not the plugins (and thus the jar) have been loaded from 
ADMINISTRATION - SYSTEM - Plugins. You should see "LaughingPanda" under the installed 
plugins.

You need to add the DisplayServlet which serves the generated images to web.xml of the
Jira application and assign it to use 

    <servlet>
	    <servlet-name>DisplayChart</servlet-name>
	    <servlet-class>org.jfree.chart.servlet.DisplayChart</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
	    <servlet-name>DisplayChart</servlet-name>
	    <url-pattern>/servlet/DisplayChart</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

If your installation is not the standalone version of JIRA, the webapp is not probably installed in 
root of the server. In this case you need to modify the ChartPortlet.properties -file inside the
.jar. The properties file contains a property named "servlet.url.DisplayChart". You should set this
string to contain the server path part of the url to the DisplayChart Servlet. For example if your
webapp is installed under /jira, you should set this value to /jira/servlet/DisplayChart.

Jira administration:
--------------------
The workload history is collected by a Jira Service implementation which stores 
snapshots of the workload to database. This service can be started from
ADMINISTRATION - SYSTEM - Services
